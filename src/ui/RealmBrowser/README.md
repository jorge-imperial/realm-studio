# The Realm Browser

By now this component is the most complex in Realm Studio and it feels necessary to start documenting its expected
behavior and the interfaces that is uses.

## Features

- See objects and their values of all classes in a Realm database (local or synched).
- External changes to the database propagates and updates the UI in near realtime.
- Update any existing primitive values, object references or lists of objects or primitives.
- Perform the updates in transactions.
- Perform the updates in one of two edit modes: As you type, one write per keystroke or when you leave the cell.
- Downloading and uploading from / to synched Realm shows a progress bar.
- Import data from a CSV.
- Export model definitions in various languages, including Swift, JavaScript, Java, Kotlin and C#.
- Open encrypted Realms.
- Realms can be opened in read-only mode, which will prevent accidental changes to them.
- Add new classes and properties to classes.
- Leaving a cell with an invalid value or while in a transaction is prevented.
- Manipulate object level permissions of reference / partial Realms.

# The abstract Focus class (this.state.focus of the RealmBrowserContainer)

An instance `this.state.focus` of the abstract `Focus` class is the part of the browsers state that represents the
subset of the data from a Realm on which the user wants to focus on.

The this.state.focus changes when the user is browsing around in the Realm.

A couple of specialization of Focus exists:
  - `ClassFocus`: The table shows objects that has a specific type from the schema.
    - Requires the name of the class to focus on.
      - From this we can derive the list of properties to use in the header.
  - `ListFocus`: The table shows objects from a list on another object.
    - Requires the parent object on which the list exists.
    - Requires the ObjectSchemaProperty representing the list property
      - From the parent object we can derive the ObjectSchema, which can be used to derive the ObjectSchemaProperty for
        the list that the browser is focussed on.
      - A special case exists where the ObjectSchemaPropertyâ€™s type is a primitive and not another class from the
        schema: In this case the table should show render the elements of the list instead of trying to find the class
        in the schema and derive the properties from that.
